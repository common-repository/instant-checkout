Enable microcheckout on your WooCommerce store to boost conversion & sales.

== Description ==
Instant is the microcheckout plugin for e-commerce stores — enable embedded checkout on every page of a store, making it possible for any shopper to checkout in less than 30 seconds from any page on the site.

Typically a shopper has to go through 4-6 different pages or steps to make a purchase, increasing their chances of abandonment at every level. The end result is that only 3% of visiting shoppers actually place an order, while 97% drop out.

Microcheckout solves that problem with a sub-30 second checkout experience from any page, especially for first time shoppers. 

== Installation ==

1. Visit [getinstant.co](https://getinstant.co/) to get started with your Instant merchant account
2. Once you have signed up, created a store in the dashboard and connected your payment provider(s), you should receive your public and secret API keys
3. Install [WooCommerce Blocks](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-gutenberg-products-block/) plugin on your WooCommerce website — this plugin is required for Instant Checkout
4. Install this plugin (Instant) on your WooCommerce website
5. Visit the settings page for Instant within your Wordpress admin panel (you should find our lightning icon on the left hand side of your admin panel after installing this plugin)
6. Enter the public and secret API keys on this page that you received from step 2 & click save

That's it! You have successfully enabled microcheckout on your store.
